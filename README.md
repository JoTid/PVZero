# PVZero

With an ESP32, the power grid data of a Shelly 3EM is queried, processed and used for current limiting with a Juntek
power supply unit, so that a zero-current feed-in of a PV system can be realised.

## Arduino Framework

The project is based on [Arduino Framework](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en) and is developed in
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/) extension.
